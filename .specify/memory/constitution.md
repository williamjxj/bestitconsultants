# BestIT Consulting Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-First Architecture
Every feature MUST be built as reusable, self-contained React components. Components MUST be independently testable, documented with TypeScript interfaces, and follow the established component hierarchy (common/, home/, layout/, ui/). No component should exist without a clear purpose and reusability potential.

### II. TypeScript-First Development
All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. No `any` types allowed without explicit justification. Interfaces MUST be defined for all data structures, API responses, and component props. Type safety is non-negotiable for maintainability and developer experience.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all features: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. Unit tests for components, integration tests for API routes, and end-to-end tests for user workflows.

### IV. Performance-First Web Standards
All pages MUST achieve Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. Images MUST be optimized with Next.js Image component. Code splitting MUST be implemented for route-based chunks. No JavaScript bundles over 250KB without justification.

### V. Accessibility & SEO Compliance
All components MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Semantic HTML required. ARIA labels mandatory for interactive elements. Meta tags, structured data, and sitemap generation MUST be implemented for all pages.

### VI. Business-First Content Strategy
All content MUST align with BestIT's core value proposition: "Canadian Quality, Global Talent." Content MUST emphasize AI-driven solutions, cost-effective outsourcing, and enterprise-grade consulting. Every page MUST include measurable outcomes and clear calls-to-action for consultation requests.

### VII. Global Network Integration
All team and service content MUST reflect the global network model: Canadian leadership with Asian talent. Content MUST showcase the collaboration between William Jiang (founder), Shamin Yang, Lewis Liu, and extended global experts. Partnership highlights with Aochuang Intelligence and Chengdu Zhanying Technology MUST be prominently featured.
