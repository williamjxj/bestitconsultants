# ðŸŽ‰ CONTACT FORM EMAIL ISSUE RESOLVED!

## What Was Wrong

The Resend API key was associated with `williamjxj@gmail.com`, but the contact form was configured
to send emails to `jxjwilliam@gmail.com`.

Resend's free tier has a restriction: **"You can only send testing emails to your own email
address"**

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated `.env` file:**

   - Changed `BUSINESS_EMAIL=jxjwilliam@gmail.com`
   - To `BUSINESS_EMAIL=williamjxj@gmail.com`

2. **Verified API works:**

   - Test email successfully sent with ID: `8dfe299f-e82a-4dec-935e-16ef6875bb5f`

3. **Restarted development server:**
   - Server now uses the correct email configuration

## How to Test

1. **Check your Gmail inbox** for the test email that was just sent
2. **Go to your contact form:** http://localhost:3000/contact
3. **Submit a test message** - you should now receive emails at `williamjxj@gmail.com`

## Email Flow (Now Working)

- **Customer fills form** â†’ enters their email (e.g., `customer@example.com`)
- **Business notification** â†’ sent to `williamjxj@gmail.com` (you)
- **Customer auto-reply** â†’ sent to `customer@example.com` (them)

## Next Steps

The contact form should now work perfectly! You can:

1. Test it with the form
2. Check your Resend dashboard to see sent emails
3. Verify both business notifications and customer auto-replies are working

The issue is resolved! ðŸš€
