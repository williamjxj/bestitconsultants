# Email Debugging Guide - ISSUE RESOLVED! ✅

## Root Cause Found & Fixed

**Problem:** Resend API key was associated with `williamjxj@gmail.com`, not `jxjwilliam@gmail.com`
**Error:** "You can only send testing emails to your own email address (williamjxj@gmail.com)"
**Solution:** Updated `BUSINESS_EMAIL=williamjxj@gmail.com` in `.env` file

## Test Results

✅ **Direct API Test:** Successfully sent email with ID `8dfe299f-e82a-4dec-935e-16ef6875bb5f` ✅
**Environment Updated:** `BUSINESS_EMAIL=williamjxj@gmail.com` ✅ **Server Restarted:** Development
server restarted to pick up new config

## Current Configuration

- **Business notification emails go to:** `williamjxj@gmail.com`
- **Customer auto-reply emails go to:** Whatever email they enter in the form
- **All emails sent from:** `BestITConsulting <onboarding@resend.dev>`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the contact form again** - emails should now be delivered to `williamjxj@gmail.com`
2. **Check your Gmail inbox** (including spam folder) for the test email that was just sent
3. **Submit a new contact form** to verify the complete flow works

## Form Field Clarification

- **"Your Email" field:** This is where the customer enters THEIR email (e.g.,
  `customer@example.com`)
- **Business notification:** Goes to `williamjxj@gmail.com` (you)
- **Customer auto-reply:** Goes to whatever email the customer entered

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When someone submits the contact form:

1. **Business gets notified at:** `williamjxj@gmail.com`
2. **Customer gets auto-reply at:** Their email address (from the form)
3. **Both emails show in Resend dashboard:** https://resend.com/dashboard

## Step 1: Check Debug Logs

After submitting the form, check your terminal/console logs for these debug messages:

```
=== CONTACT FORM DEBUG ===
Customer email (from form): jxjwilliam@2925.com
Customer name: [name entered]
Business email (where notification goes): jxjwilliam@gmail.com
Resend API Key configured: YES
Attempting to send business notification email...
Business email result: [should show success or error]
Attempting to send customer auto-reply email...
Customer email result: [should show success or error]
```

## Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Check your `.env` file contains:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY="re_azAhdY7r_HBcqg14GDsmUMbjw8rmWh756"
BUSINESS_EMAIL="jxjwilliam@gmail.com"
```

## Step 3: Test Resend API Directly

Run this test to verify Resend API works:

```bash
cd /Users/william.jiang/my-playgrounds/BestIT/bestitconsultants
node test-resend.js
```

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Gmail Spam Folder

**Check:** Gmail spam/junk folder for emails from `onboarding@resend.dev`

### Issue 2: Gmail Filtering

**Gmail Settings:**

1. Go to Gmail Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses
2. Check if any filters are blocking emails from resend.dev

### Issue 3: Resend API Key Issues

**Verify in Resend Dashboard:**

1. Login to https://resend.com/dashboard
2. Go to API Keys section
3. Verify key `re_azAhdY7r_HBcqg14GDsmUMbjw8rmWh756` exists and is active

### Issue 4: Domain Verification (if using custom domain)

**Current Setup:** Using Resend's verified domain `onboarding@resend.dev` - no verification needed

### Issue 5: Rate Limiting

**Resend Limits:**

- Free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000 emails/month
- Check if you've hit limits in Resend dashboard

## Step 5: Manual Test Email

Try sending a manual test email through Resend dashboard:

1. Go to https://resend.com/dashboard
2. Use "Send Test Email" feature
3. Send to `jxjwilliam@gmail.com`
4. Check if it arrives

## Step 6: Alternative Email Testing

Try testing with a different email address:

1. Use a different email service (Yahoo, Outlook)
2. Or create a temporary Gmail account
3. Test if emails arrive there

## Step 7: Check Server Logs

If running on Vercel/deployment:

1. Check deployment logs
2. Look for any error messages during email sending

## Quick Fix Attempts

### Fix 1: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Clear Environment Variables Cache

```bash
# Stop server, restart terminal, then:
npm run dev
```

### Fix 3: Verify Package Installation

```bash
npm list resend
# Should show: resend@4.7.0
```

## Expected Behavior

When form is submitted correctly:

1. **Business Email TO:** `jxjwilliam@gmail.com`
2. **Customer Email TO:** `jxjwilliam@2925.com`
3. **Both emails FROM:** `BestITConsulting <onboarding@resend.dev>`
4. **Resend Dashboard:** Should show 2 emails sent

## Next Steps

1. Submit form again and check terminal logs
2. Check Gmail spam folder
3. Try the direct Resend test script
4. Let me know what the debug logs show!
