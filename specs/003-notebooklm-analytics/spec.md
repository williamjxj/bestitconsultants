# Feature Specification: NotebookLM Analytics

**Feature Branch**: `003-notebooklm-analytics` **Created**: 2024-12-19 **Status**: Draft **Input**:
User description: "notebooklm analytics"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd
   need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth
   method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous"
   checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a NotebookLM user, I want to view analytics about my notebook usage and content so that I can
understand how I'm engaging with my documents and improve my research workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has created notebooks in NotebookLM, **When** they access the analytics
   dashboard, **Then** they should see summary statistics about their notebook usage
2. **Given** a user has multiple notebooks, **When** they view analytics, **Then** they should be
   able to see which notebooks are most frequently accessed
3. **Given** a user has been using NotebookLM over time, **When** they check analytics, **Then**
   they should see usage trends and patterns over time
4. **Given** a user wants to understand their content, **When** they view analytics, **Then** they
   should see insights about document types, topics, and content organization

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no notebooks yet?
- How does the system handle users with very large numbers of notebooks?
- What happens when analytics data is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle users who have deleted notebooks?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display total number of notebooks created by the user
- **FR-002**: System MUST show most frequently accessed notebooks with access counts
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide usage statistics over time (daily, weekly, monthly views)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display document type distribution (PDF, text, web pages, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST show content analysis insights (topics, keywords, document length)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to filter analytics by date range
- **FR-007**: System MUST display notebook creation and modification timestamps
- **FR-008**: System MUST show search query analytics and most common searches
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide export functionality for analytics data
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what level of data privacy - should analytics
  be aggregated or detailed per document?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Notebook**: Represents a user's document collection with metadata (creation date, last accessed,
  document count)
- **Analytics Data**: Aggregated usage statistics including access patterns, content metrics, and
  user engagement
- **Document**: Individual files within notebooks with properties (type, size, processing status)
- **Usage Event**: Record of user interactions (views, searches, modifications) with timestamps
