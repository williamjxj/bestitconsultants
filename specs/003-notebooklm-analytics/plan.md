# Implementation Plan: Website Evolution & Enhancement

**Branch**: `003-notebooklm-analytics` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [link] **Input**: Website
improvement requirements for professional, impressive, UI-friendly presentation

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Web application (Option 2) - frontend + backend API routes

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - Research best practices for professional website messaging and value proposition positioning
   - Research modern UI/UX patterns for consulting websites
   - Research case study presentation and data visualization techniques
   - Research team profile optimization and credibility building strategies
   - Research AI/ML service positioning and marketing strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   Task: "Research professional messaging strategies for consulting websites"
   Task: "Find best practices for team profile presentation and credibility building"
   Task: "Research case study data visualization and outcome presentation"
   Task: "Research AI/ML service positioning and enterprise marketing"
   Task: "Find modern UI/UX patterns for professional consulting websites"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all research findings consolidated

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Team member profiles with enhanced presentation
   - Case study data with measurable outcomes
   - Service categories with SEO-optimized content
   - Content structure for professional messaging

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - Team profile API endpoints
   - Case study data endpoints
   - Content management endpoints
   - SEO metadata endpoints

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - Add new technologies and patterns from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md) **Phase 4**: Implementation (execute
tasks.md following constitutional principles) **Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute
quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation | Why Needed             | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                   |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| N/A       | No violations detected | All enhancements comply with constitutional principles |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
