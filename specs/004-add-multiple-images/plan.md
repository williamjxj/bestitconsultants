# Implementation Plan: Multiple Images and Videos in Webpage

**Branch**: `004-add-multiple-images` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [link] **Input**: Feature
specification from `/specs/004-add-multiple-images/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Replace image placeholders throughout the website with meaningful images from the `R2 bucket static-assets`
folder, add animations and hover effects using Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS, and enhance the
visual experience with cool interactive elements while maintaining performance and accessibility
standards.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React 19, Next.js 15 **Primary Dependencies**: Framer Motion,
Next.js Image, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui **Storage**: Static files in publicR2 bucket  and public/images/
folders **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E **Target Platform**: Web
browsers (desktop, tablet, mobile) **Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1, 60fps animations **Constraints**: WCAG
2.1 AA compliance, Core Web Vitals, mobile-first responsive design **Scale/Scope**: 9 new images,
multiple page sections, enhanced user experience

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Component-First Architecture ✅

- All image components will be built as reusable React components
- Components will be independently testable with TypeScript interfaces
- Following established component hierarchy (common/, home/, layout/, ui/)

### TypeScript-First Development ✅

- All components will use strict TypeScript typing
- No `any` types allowed
- Interfaces defined for all image props and metadata

### Test-Driven Development ✅

- Tests will be written before implementation
- Unit tests for image components
- Integration tests for image loading and display
- E2E tests for user interactions

### Performance-First Web Standards ✅

- Next.js Image component for optimization
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Code splitting for animation libraries
- Core Web Vitals compliance maintained

### Accessibility & SEO Compliance ✅

- Alt text for all images
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- SEO-optimized image metadata

### Business-First Content Strategy ✅

- Images will showcase company work and team
- Professional presentation aligned with BestIT branding
- Clear visual hierarchy supporting business goals

### Animation Requirements ✅

- Framer Motion for all animations
- Smooth page transitions and hover effects
- 60fps performance on mobile devices
- Respect user motion preferences

**Structure Decision**: Web application (Option 2) - frontend + backend structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - Image format optimization (WebP, AVIF support)
   - Animation performance best practices
   - Accessibility requirements for media content
   - SEO optimization for images

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research image optimization for Next.js with WebP/AVIF support"
     Task: "Research Framer Motion performance best practices for web"
     Task: "Research accessibility requirements for images and videos"
     Task: "Research SEO optimization for media content"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - MediaAsset entity with metadata fields
   - MediaGallery entity for collections
   - MediaCategory entity for classification
   - Image component props and state

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - Image optimization endpoints
   - Media metadata endpoints
   - Animation configuration endpoints
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md) **Phase 4**: Implementation (execute
tasks.md following constitutional principles) **Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute
quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation | Why Needed             | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A       | No violations detected | All requirements align with constitutional principles |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
