# Feature Specification: Multiple Images and Videos in Webpage

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-multiple-images` **Created**: 2024-12-19 **Status**: Draft **Input**:
User description: "add multiple images, videos in the webpage."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd
   need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth
   method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous"
   checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to view multiple images and videos throughout the website so that I can
better understand the company's work, team, and services through visual content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** they should
   see multiple relevant images showcasing the company's work and team
2. **Given** a user visits the team page, **When** they view team member profiles, **Then** they
   should see professional photos of each team member
3. **Given** a user visits the case studies page, **When** they view project details, **Then** they
   should see project screenshots, diagrams, or demo videos
4. **Given** a user visits the services page, **When** they explore different service categories,
   **Then** they should see relevant images or videos demonstrating each service
5. **Given** a user visits the portfolio page, **When** they browse projects, **Then** they should
   see project galleries with multiple images and video demonstrations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when images fail to load or are corrupted?
- How does the system handle very large image files or long videos?
- What happens when users have slow internet connections?
- How does the system handle different screen sizes and devices for media display?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display multiple images throughout the website pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST support video content playback on relevant pages
- **FR-003**: System MUST optimize images for different screen sizes and devices
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fallback content when images fail to load
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure all media content is accessible with proper alt text and captions
- **FR-006**: System MUST load media content efficiently without significantly impacting page
  performance
- **FR-007**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which image formats - JPEG, PNG, WebP,
  AVIF?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which video formats - MP4, WebM, other?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file sizes for images and videos?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: image gallery functionality - lightbox,
  carousel, grid view?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: video controls - autoplay, volume,
  fullscreen?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: responsive behavior for media on mobile
  devices?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Media Asset**: Represents individual image or video files with metadata (title, description, alt
  text, file size, dimensions)
- **Media Gallery**: Collection of related media assets organized by page or section
- **Media Category**: Classification of media by type (team photos, project screenshots, service
  demonstrations, company logos)
