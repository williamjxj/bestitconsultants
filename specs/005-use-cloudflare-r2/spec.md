# Feature Specification: Use Cloudflare R2 Static Buckets to Replace @R2 bucket static-assets Folder

**Feature Branch**: `005-use-cloudflare-r2` **Created**: 2025-01-27 **Status**: Draft **Input**:
User description: "use cloudflare r2 static buckets to replace @public/ imgs folder."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd
   need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth
   method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous"
   checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to view images on the website without experiencing slower load times,
so that I can have a better browsing experience and the website can handle more traffic efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the website is loading, **When** I visit any page with images, **Then** all images
   should load from the cloud storage service without errors
2. **Given** I am browsing the portfolio page, **When** I view project images, **Then** the images
   should display with the same quality and performance as before
3. **Given** the website is experiencing high traffic, **When** multiple users access image-heavy
   pages, **Then** the images should load quickly without impacting the main server
4. **Given** a user is on a slow connection, **When** they load pages with images, **Then** the
   images should still load efficiently due to CDN optimization

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the cloud storage service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle image requests when the cloud storage has maintenance windows?
- What occurs if an image file is accidentally deleted from the cloud storage?
- How does the system handle very large image files that exceed cloud storage limits?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST serve all images from cloud storage instead of local public folder
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain the same image URLs and paths for existing content
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure all existing images (12 files in R2 bucket) are accessible after
  migration
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide fallback behavior when cloud storage is unavailable [NEEDS
  CLARIFICATION: what specific fallback behavior - cached images, error messages, or local
  fallback?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain image optimization and performance characteristics
- **FR-006**: System MUST support the same image formats currently used (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle image requests without breaking existing API endpoints
  (/api/media/assets, /api/media/galleries)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain image metadata and alt text functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure images load with appropriate caching headers for performance
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a migration process that doesn't require code changes in
  components that reference images

### Key Entities

- **Image Asset**: Represents a media file stored in cloud storage with metadata (filename, format,
  size, URL)
- **Cloud Storage Bucket**: Container for organized image assets with access controls and CDN
  integration
- **Image Reference**: Path or URL used by application components to access image assets
