4. Verify Core Web Vitals scores:
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
   - FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1

### Animation Performance

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Navigate to Performance tab
3. Record page interactions
4. Verify animations maintain 60fps
5. Check for layout thrashing or jank

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Animations not working**:
