# Feature Specification: Enhanced UI/UX with Simplified Navigation and AI News Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-ui-ux-enhancement` **Created**: 2025-01-27 **Status**: Draft **Input**:
User description: "Enhanced UI/UX with simplified navigation, animations, and AI news page -

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd
   need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth
   method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous"
   checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, I want to navigate the BestIT Consulting website with an intuitive, modern
interface that provides smooth animations and easy access to AI industry news, so that I can quickly
find information about services and stay updated with the latest AI trends.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the homepage, **When** they scroll through the page, **Then** they see
   smooth fade-in animations for each section
2. **Given** a user wants to navigate the site, **When** they look at the navigation menu, **Then**
   they see a simplified menu with clear categories and no testimonials link
3. **Given** a user wants to read client feedback, **When** they scroll to the footer, **Then** they
   see testimonials prominently displayed with enhanced styling
4. **Given** a user wants to stay updated with AI trends, **When** they click on "AI News" in the
   navigation, **Then** they access a dedicated page with latest AI industry news
5. **Given** a user interacts with buttons or cards, **When** they hover over elements, **Then**
   they see smooth scale and color transition effects

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has motion sensitivity preferences enabled?
- How does the system handle slow network connections during animation loading?
- What happens when a user navigates quickly between pages with animations?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a simplified navigation menu with maximum 7 items organized by
  logical categories
