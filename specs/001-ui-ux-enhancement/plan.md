# Implementation Plan: Enhanced UI/UX with Simplified Navigation and AI News Integration

**Branch**: `001-ui-ux-enhancement` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**:
`/specs/001-ui-ux-enhancement/spec.md` **Input**: Feature specification from
`/specs/001-ui-ux-enhancement/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Web application (Next.js frontend) - Option 2 structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - Animation performance optimization techniques
   - Framer Motion best practices for web applications
   - shadcn/ui component integration patterns
   - Mobile-first responsive animation strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research Framer Motion performance optimization for Next.js applications"
     Task: "Research shadcn/ui component integration with existing Tailwind setup"
     Task: "Research mobile-first animation patterns for web accessibility"
     Task: "Research Core Web Vitals optimization with animation libraries"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Framer Motion with performance optimizations
   - Rationale: Industry standard for React animations with excellent Next.js integration
   - Alternatives considered: CSS animations (limited control), other animation libraries (less
     React integration)

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - NavigationItem: category, label, href, order
   - Testimonial: quote, author, title, company
   - AINewsArticle: title, excerpt, date, category, trending, tags
   - AnimationState: motionPreference, animationEnabled, performanceMode

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - Navigation API: GET /api/navigation (menu structure)
   - Testimonials API: GET /api/testimonials (footer content)
   - AI News API: GET /api/ai-news (news articles with filtering)
   - Animation API: GET /api/animation-preferences (user settings)

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - Navigation contract tests
   - Testimonials contract tests
   - AI News contract tests
   - Animation preference tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Navigation user journey tests
   - Animation performance tests
   - AI News filtering tests
   - Testimonials display tests

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Add Framer Motion and shadcn/ui to agent context
   - Update recent changes (navigation, animations, AI news)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md) **Phase 4**: Implementation (execute
tasks.md following constitutional principles) **Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute
quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation             | Why Needed                                 | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framer Motion library | Smooth animations required for modern UX   | CSS animations insufficient for complex page transitions          |
| shadcn/ui components  | Consistent design system and accessibility | Custom components would require extensive testing and maintenance |
