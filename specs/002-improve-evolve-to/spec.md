## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd
   need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth
   method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous"
   checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a potential client visiting the BestIT Consulting website, I want to quickly understand the
company's expertise and services so that I can make an informed decision about engaging their
services.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they scan the content, **Then** they should
   immediately understand BestIT's core value proposition and services within 10 seconds
2. **Given** a visitor is looking for specific services, **When** they navigate to the services
   page, **Then** they should find clear, concise descriptions of each service offering

  credibility?

  consulting?

  BestIT's offerings?
