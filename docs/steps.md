## integration gemini-2.5-pro version

Please analyze the `gemini.js` file and refactor its code by separating it into appropriate components and files. Organize these files into suitable folders within the project structure, creating any necessary folders if they do not already exist. Ensure that after refactoring, all functionalities originally contained in `gemini.js` continue to work correctly within the app.
